# Embeddable.com Starter Pack

Hello and welcome to our Embeddable components **starter pack** built just for you by the Embeddable team ❤️ We wish to thank you for using our platform and welcome any feedback.

![example-dash](https://github.com/embeddable-hq/vanilla-components/assets/6795003/3f38f938-7848-4e25-8cc0-90160398f0a1)

### Installation

The easiest way to get started with this starter pack is to [follow the documentation](https://docs.embeddable.com/getting-started/download-starter-repo).

However, if you want to roll your own boilerplate, you can add these components with `npm i @embeddable.com/vanilla-components @embeddable.com/react @embeddable.com/core @embeddable.com/sdk-react @embeddable.com/sdk-core` (requires node 20 or later).

### Build & Deploy

This is how you push code changes to your Embeddable workspace

1.  Head to https://app.us.embeddable.com (or https://app.eu.embeddable.com) and grab your **API Key**.

2.  **Set your location**: in [embeddable.config.ts](./embeddable.config.ts), uncomment either the US or EU config section.

3.  **Build** the code bundle: `npm run embeddable:build`

4.  **Push** the above code bundle to your workspace:

`npm run embeddable:push -- --api-key <API Key> --email <Email> --message <Message>`

4.  Head back to https://app.embeddable.com (or https://app.eu.embeddable.com) and "Create new Embeddable" using the **components** and **models** from your code bundle

### Local Development

This is a "Preview workspace" (local to you) that allows you make changes locally and see them instantly without needing to "Build and Deploy".

`npm run embeddable:dev` (note: you may need to run `npm run embeddable:login` first)

It opens a "Preview" workspace, that uses your local components and models.
